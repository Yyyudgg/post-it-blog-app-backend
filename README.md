## Project Overview

The **Post-It Blog App Backend** is designed to provide a seamless experience for users looking to create, read, update, and delete blog posts. It leverages the power of Node.js and Express to build a RESTful API, while MongoDB serves as the database for storing user and post data. The application also implements JWT-based authentication for secure user sessions.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure user login and registration using JWT.
- **Password Security**: Passwords are hashed using bcrypt to enhance security.
- **CRUD Operations**: Create, read, update, and delete blog posts with ease.
- **RESTful API**: Well-structured API endpoints for easy integration.
- **Scalability**: Built with scalability in mind, suitable for future enhancements.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for building server-side applications.
- **Express**: Web framework for Node.js, used for building APIs.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing data.
- **Mongoose**: ODM for MongoDB and Node.js.
- **JWT**: JSON Web Tokens for secure authentication.
- **bcrypt**: Library for hashing passwords.

## Installation

To get started with the Post-It Blog App Backend, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Yyyudgg/post-it-blog-app-backend.git
   cd post-it-blog-app-backend
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Run the following command to install the necessary packages:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Environment Variables**:
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following variables:
   ```
   PORT=5000
   MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
   ```

4. **Start the Server**:
   Use the following command to start the server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

Your backend server should now be running on `http://localhost:5000`.

## Usage

Once the server is running, you can use tools like Postman or Insomnia to interact with the API. The API endpoints allow you to manage blog posts and user authentication.

## API Endpoints

Here are the main API endpoints available in the Post-It Blog App Backend:

### User Authentication

- **Register a new user**:
  - `POST /api/auth/register`
  - Body: `{ "username": "your_username", "password": "your_password" }`

- **Login a user**:
  - `POST /api/auth/login`
  - Body: `{ "username": "your_username", "password": "your_password" }`

### Blog Posts

- **Create a new post**:
  - `POST /api/posts`
  - Headers: `Authorization: Bearer your_jwt_token`
  - Body: `{ "title": "Post Title", "content": "Post Content" }`

- **Get all posts**:
  - `GET /api/posts`

- **Get a single post**:
  - `GET /api/posts/:id`

- **Update a post**:
  - `PUT /api/posts/:id`
  - Headers: `Authorization: Bearer your_jwt_token`
  - Body: `{ "title": "Updated Title", "content": "Updated Content" }`

- **Delete a post**:
  - `DELETE /api/posts/:id`
  - Headers: `Authorization: Bearer your_jwt_token`

## Authentication

The application uses JWT for user authentication. After a successful login, the server generates a token that the client must include in the `Authorization` header for protected routes. This token allows the server to verify the user's identity.
